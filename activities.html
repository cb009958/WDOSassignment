                        The aquarium, which is a star attraction of the zoo, consists freshwater, marine and brackish 
                        water sections. It was established for 40 years.
                        
                        Many fish species and corals, mollusks, echinoderms and arthropods are in 22 tanks.Visitors 
                        could observation most behavior patterns of these aquatic organisms such as breeding, colonization,
                        symbiosis and competition etc., from outside the tank.
                        There are 50 fish species identified as endemic to Sri Lanka. Out of them many different varieties 
                        are exhibited in the aquarium. Very rare varieties of fish including endemics have been bred in the 
                        aquarium and in zoo ponds as well.
